      <h3>Keys</h3>
      <p>
        In a DBMS (Database Management System), keys are used to uniquely
        identify records (rows) in a table. They ensure data integrity and help
        establish relationships between tables. Below are the main types of
        keys:
      </p>

      <h3>Primary Key</h3>
      <p>
        A primary key uniquely identifies each record in a table, ensuring no
        duplicates and requiring every record to have a unique identifier, thus
        preventing NULL values within its domain. It acts as the foundation for
        maintaining data integrity and enforcing relationships between tables.
      </p>

      <h3>Foreign Key</h3>
      <p>
        A foreign key is a field in one table that references the primary key in
        another table, establishing a relationship between the two. It enforces
        referential integrity by ensuring that values in the foreign key column
        match values in the primary key column of the referenced table.
      </p>

      <h3>Candidate Key</h3>
      <p>
        A candidate key is any field or combination of fields that can uniquely
        identify a record in a table. A table can have multiple candidate keys,
        but only one of the candidate keys can be chosen as the primary key.
      </p>

      <h3>Alternate Key</h3>
      <p>
        An alternate key is a candidate key that is not chosen as the primary
        key. In cases where there are two or more candidate keys, only one of
        them is selected to serve as the primary key. The alternate key provides
        an alternative identifier for a record and is unique within the table,
        offering additional options for data retrieval and maintenance.
      </p>

      <h3>Super Key</h3>
      <p>
        A super key is a set of attributes (columns) that can uniquely identify
        a record within a table. It can contain more attributes than necessary
        to uniquely identify a record. In other words, it is a superset of a
        candidate key.
