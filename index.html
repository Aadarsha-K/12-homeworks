      <h1>Database Management System</h1>
      <p>
        A Database Management System (DBMS) is software designed to manage,
        retrieve, and manipulate data in a database. It enables users to create
        and maintain a database. Below are some terms commonly used in DBMS:
      </p><ul>
        
        <li>
          <h3>Data</h3>
          <p>
            Data is raw information that can be processed by a computer. Data is the
            raw facts that, after processing, become information. Example:
            Kathmandu, 20, etc.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Information</h3>
          <p>
            Information refers to data that has been processed and analyzed to
            provide meaningful output.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Metadata</h3>
          <p>
            Metadata is the data that provides information about other data. It
            provides context and descriptions about data.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Data Dictionary</h3>
          <p>
            A data dictionary is a centralized repository that provides detailed
            definitions and attributes for data elements used within a database.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Database</h3>
          <p>
            A database is an organized collection of structured information stored
            electronically, typically managed by a Database Management System
            (DBMS). It serves as a repository of related information about a
            subject. Examples include businesses using databases to store customer
            information, schools managing student records, and online stores
            tracking product inventories.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Table</h3>
          <p>A table in a database organizes data into rows and columns.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Tuple(s)</h3>
          <p>A tuple in databases refers to a single row within a table that contains a specific set of data.</p>
        </li>
        
        <li>
          <h3>Field(s)</h3>
          <p>
            Fields are individual pieces of data within a database table that
            represent attributes of records.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Domain</h3>
          <p>
            The domain specifies the complete set of values that an attribute or column can contain within a database table.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Constraint</h3>
          <p>
            Constraints enforce rules on data columns to ensure accuracy, integrity,
            and validity.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Key(s)</h3>
          <p>
            Key is an attribute used to uniquely identify records in a table. Primary keys, foreign keys, and alternate keys are some types of keys used in databases.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
